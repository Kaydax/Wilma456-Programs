NAME
       cowsay - configurable speaking cow (and a bit more)

SYNOPSIS
       cowsay [OPTIONS] text

DESCRIPTION
       Cowsay  generates  an  ASCII  picture of a cow saying something provided by the user.  If run with no arguments, it accepts standard input,
       word-wraps the message given at about 40 columns, and prints the cow saying the given message on standard output.

       To aid in the use of arbitrary messages with arbitrary whitespace, use the -n option.  If it is specified, the given message  will  not  be
       word-wrapped.   This is possibly useful if you want to make the cow think or speak in figlet(6).  If -n is specified, there must not be any
       command-line arguments left after all the switches have been processed.

       If  any  command-line  arguments are left over after all switches have been processed, they become the cow's message.  The program will not
       accept standard input for a message in this case.

       The  user  may  specify  the  -e  option to select the appearance of the cow's eyes, in which case the first two characters of the argument
       string eye_string will be used.  The default eyes are 'oo'.  The tongue is similarly configurable through -T and tongue_string; it must  be
       two characters and does not appear by default.  However, it does appear in the 'dead' and 'stoned' modes.  Any configuration done by -e and
       -T will be lost if one of the provided modes is used.

       The -f option specifies a particular cow picture file (``cowfile'') to use.  If the cowfile spec contains '/' then it will  be  interpreted
       as  a  path  relative  to the current directory.  Otherwise, cowsay will search the path specified in the COWPATH environment variable.  To
       list all cowfiles on the current COWPATH, invoke cowsay with the -l switch.
